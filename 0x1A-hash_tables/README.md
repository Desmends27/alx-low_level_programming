This is a simple implementation of a hash table in C programming language. It provides basic functionalities of inserting, retrieving, and deleting key-value pairs using a hash function and separate chaining to handle collisions. The hash table is implemented as an array of buckets, with each bucket containing a linked list of key-value pairs.It uses the DJB2 algorithim for hashing
